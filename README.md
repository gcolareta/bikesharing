As observed in these images, most bike trips occur in Manhattan. This could indicate a high demand for the bike service amongst tourists. To explore more this trend, we looked at the customers' breakdown, the times of the day when the bike sharing service is used the most and the duration of the trips.

- Most customers purchase a subscription to use the bikes.
- The trip duration is predominantly short with most rides lasting less than 20 minutes.
- However, it is interesting to observe that most rides are happening Monday thru Friday between 7 - 9 a.m. and 5 - 7 p.m. Hours when people are going to and coming back from work.
- It is also observed that as the weekend approaches, the bike usage increases. As noted from Thursday to Sunday.

The following visualizations, show that the majority of subscribers who use this service are male and that the peak hours in august are between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m.

### Summary

- Based on the data, NYC visitors as well as locals use the bike sharing service to get around the city.
- Most customers purchase subscriptions and trips are short, lasting less than 20 minutes. This might be due to the different types of memberships offered by Citi Bike in NYC. Customers can purchase either a 24 hour, 7 day or an annual subscription which encourages short trips by offering unlimited 30 minute rides included with the memberships. Moreover, because they offer a variety of choices, visitors as well as locals can take advantage of the perks of getting around the city riding bikes.
- Since most bikes are being used during rush hour, this idea can be proposed as an alternative for public and private transportation for visitors and locals alike.
- It would be interesting to further explore why male customers are using the service significantly more than female ones.
- These results and visualizations have been created using data for the month of August alone. It would be helpful to explore trends for the warmer months in the city.
